  ## Description 
  This application was designed to be a database of reference art that is friendly to professional artists.  It's core is the use of the Google Visions API.  Rather than using keywords to search for an image, the user can simply upload an image, and the API will then scan it, generate tags based on the image, and then compare the image uploaded to images in the database.  It will then bring back all images that have tags in common sorted in descending order, so that the images that will be most similar to the one the user uploaded will appear first.
