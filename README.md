  ## Description 
  This application was designed to be a database of reference art that is friendly to professional artists.  It's core is the use of the Google Visions API.  Rather than using keywords to search for an image, the user can simply upload an image, and the API will then scan it, generate tags based on the image, and then compare the image uploaded to images in the database.  It will then bring back all images that have tags in common sorted in descending order, so that the images that will be most similar to the one the user uploaded will appear first.

  - A response will come back with images that are in the database that are similar to it with the tags listed out, and a confidence rating.  The images with most similarities will be listed first.

   - The user now has the option to save any of the images from the search results to their personal assets page called "my assets", and the image uploaded will also now be stored in the database and available to view in the "all assets" page along with all the other images in the database, where the user can also look for images to save to their personal assets page.
